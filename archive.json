All things being equal, provided there is no specific process reason to have the plain english only version, we intend move the algorithm specifications to that form.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been created to track the choice we make here",

Without the context that I already have, I'm not sure its clear from the definition if `e` is the subset of `i` that are leaves, or if `e` is a zero-based enumeration of the leaves.\r\n2. It might be more intuitive to just inline `(h - 1)` rather than adding `g` as an additional variable to remember.\r\n3. Extend the zero-based and one-based descriptions to all of the variables where relevant (e.g. for `i` and `pos`.)\r\n4. Later in the document, `D` is referred to, without a definition - so it might be helpful to add that here.",

          "body": "I've gone with using almost exclusively `g` or `g+1`. Zero based height indices are what most of the algorithms naturaly want to work with.\r\n\r\nI've also made it so that ALL arguments to ALL algorithms accept node indices. 'pos' or size 's' is often used as an internal detail, but is never part of the index. This includes peaks which previously retuend a list of positions.\r\n\r\nI think this mostly addresses this. Except for D which I'll address seperately",
